# Intro

A mathematician dabbling in physics, software enginner, SRE, platform engineer and FOSS enthusiast.

# Currently

At SAP I am developing the SAP Cloud platform focusing on secret managment and access policy. On a daily basis I developed features, squash bugs, craft platform tools, as well as build and maintain CI/CD pipelines.

# Previously

At VMWare I was developing a DBaaS and Data Service Manager, an on-prem database managment system. The teams at VMWare are true self-sufficient DevOps teams. We were developers, SRE's, platform engineers and customer support all at once.

At Sciant I was spinning cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, self hosted pipeline runners, a version control system, as well as any other infrastructure and all IT administration tasks that need attention. The Sysadmin/DevOps team solved the full spectrum of IT tasks, from the mundane user issues or order placements up to infrastructure architecture design, implementation, SRE, HA, security, monitoring and debugging accross on-site, hybrid, and cloud native landscapes. We'd supported Sciant internally and provided DevOps as a service.

# Some History

- My father bought our first PC in 1992, when I was 3. It had an i386 CPU with a turbo button.

- We subscribed to Dial-up Internet in the era of duplex phone lines. I still hear the fax-like connection noises and the neighbors pleading to use the phone line.

- My favorite games were games like Duke Nukem 2D or Sokoban.

- When I was nine, I read *A Brief History of Time* by Stephen Hawking. I wanted to understand how the world works ever since.

- At 15, my family won a green card. So I moved to the US, where three fond years flew by.

- At 18, I moved back to Europe, to graduate from the European Baccalaureate program.

- Believing that physics students use words they do not understand too often, I enrolled with mathematics at the University of Sofia. Throughout my university studies I auditioned as many extracurricular courses as I could.
